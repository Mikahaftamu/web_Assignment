            <p>Did you know? Founder Jack Taylor selected the name “Enterprise” as a salute to the WWII aircraft carrier he served on, the USS Enterprise. Today, the “Enterprise” name is synonymous with leadership and vision in the business.</p> 
            <h2 class="font-semibold underline font-serif">Milestones</h2> <ul> <li>1957: Jack Taylor founds Executive Leasing Company in St. Louis with seven cars and a hunch that customers will embrace the novel concept of leasing automobiles.</li> <li>1962: Executive Leasing Co. adds a rental car business division with a fleet of 17 vehicles, catering to customers who need to rent cars while theirs are in the shop.</li> 
            <li>1969: Jack renames his growing operation “Enterprise” in honor of the aircraft carrier aboard which he served in World War II, marking the company’s expansion beyond St. Louis.</li> </ul> </div>
